# Crucial CQRS

A WebAPI, Entity Framework, AngularJS (and ~~soon~~ now SignalR) sample project to demonstrate CQRS and Event Sourcing. 

Inspiration and adapation of code from:
- http://prodinner.codeplex.com/
- http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/555855/Introduction-to-CQRS
- http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/getting-started/tutorial-server-broadcast-with-signalr

## Components
- AngularJS (with [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/) )
- [ValueInjector](http://valueinjecter.codeplex.com/)
- EntityFramework 6 (Code first with adapted [Reverse POCO generator](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee4fcff9-0c4c-4179-afd9-7a2fb90f5838))
- WebAPI
- [StructureMap](http://docs.structuremap.net/)
- [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)
- [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4)

## Points of Interest
- Query database is recreated from Event Store on every application load (see `.API/global.asax.cs` for details)
- UI is notified of events via SignalR, not directly via UI interactions (try experimenting with multiple browser windows)
- Snapshots (Mementos) are generated and stored in the Event Store so replaying from last snapshot is faster than from entire history 

## Getting started

- Install node.js & npm package manager (https://nodejs.org/download/)
- `cd ./Web`
- `npm install bower`
- `bower install`

### Update connection strings in `./API/web.config`
Databases will be created automatically as long as the connection string database server and credentials are correct

### Run
Pressing play in Visual Studio should start the Web [http://localhost:6307](http://localhost:6307) project and the API project [http://localhost:41194](http://localhost:41194)

### Grunt (Optional)
You can also optionally run the web project from the Web folder if you install grunt:
- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- `npm install grunt`
- `npm install grunt-contrib-connect --save-dev`
You can then run `grunt connect` to view [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Roadmap
- Diagrams explaining architecture
- Restore query database form latest snapshot instead of replay entire event history
- More test coverage
- More complex examples of aggregates
- Remove dependency for UI to keep track of versions
- Gracefully handle version clashes (Concurrency exceptions)
